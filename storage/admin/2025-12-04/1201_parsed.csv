Then for $A \geq 0$, we have $W^h \geq W_0(1 + r_f)$. If relative risk aversion, $R_r(W) \equiv WR(W)$, is increasing in wealth, this implies

$$
W ^ {h} R \left(W ^ {h}\right) _ {\geq} W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) R \left(W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right)\right) \tag {6.1}
$$

Multiplying both sides of (6.1) by $-U^{\prime}(W^{h})(r^{h} - r_{f})$, which is a negative quantity, the inequality sign changes:

$$
W ^ {h} U ^ {\prime \prime} \left(W ^ {h}\right) \left(r ^ {h} - r _ {f}\right) \leq - U ^ {\prime} \left(W ^ {h}\right) \left(r ^ {h} - r _ {f}\right) W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) R \left(W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right)\right) \tag {6.2}
$$

Next, let $r^l$ denote a realization of $\tilde{r}$ such that it is lower than $r_f$, and let $W^l$ be the corresponding level of $W$. Then for $A \geq 0$, we have $W^l \leq W_0(1 + r_f)$. If relative risk aversion is increasing in wealth, this implies

$$
W ^ {l} R \left(W ^ {l}\right) \leq W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) R \left(W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right)\right) \tag {6.3}
$$

Multiplying (6.3) by $-U^{\prime}(W^{l})(r^{l} - r_{f})$, which is positive, so that the sign of (6.3) remains the same, we obtain

$$
W ^ {l} U ^ {\prime \prime} \left(W ^ {l}\right) \left(r ^ {l} - r _ {f}\right) \leq - U ^ {\prime} \left(W ^ {l}\right) \left(r ^ {l} - r _ {f}\right) W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) R \left(W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right)\right) \tag {6.4}
$$

Notice that inequalities (6.2) and (6.4) are of the same form. The inequality holds whether the realization is $\tilde{r} = r^h$ or $\tilde{r} = r^l$. Therefore, if we take expectations over all realizations, where $\tilde{r}$ can be either higher than or lower than $r_f$, we obtain

$$
E [ \bar {W} U ^ {\prime} (\bar {W}) (\tilde {r} - r _ {f}) ] \leq - E [ U ^ {\prime} (\bar {W}) (r - r _ {f}) ] W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) R \left(W _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right)\right) \tag {6.5}
$$

Since the first term on the right-hand-side is just the first order condition, inequality (6.5) reduces to

$$
E [ \bar {W} U ^ {\prime} (\bar {W}) (\tilde {r} - r _ {f}) ] \leq 0 \tag {6.6}
$$

Thus, we see that an individual with increasing relative risk aversion has

$$
\eta = 1 + \frac {E [ U ^ {\prime \prime} (\bar {W}) (\tilde {r} - r _ {f}) \bar {W} ]}{- A E [ U ^ {\prime \prime} (\bar {W}) (\tilde {r} - r _ {f}) ^ {2} ]} <   1 \tag {6.7}

Consider a third portfolio located in $(R_p, \sigma_p)$ space that happens to be on a straight line between portfolios 1 and 2, that is, a portfolio having a mean and standard deviation satisfying $\overline{R}_{3p} = x\overline{R}_{1p} + (1 - x)\overline{R}_{2p}$ and $\sigma_{3p} = x\sigma_{1p} + (1 - x)\sigma_{2p}$ where $0 < x < 1$ . Prove that the indifference curve is convex by showing that the expected utility of portfolio 3 exceeds $U$ .

Since $\tilde{y}_i = \tilde{P}_1 + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i$ and $\tilde{\varepsilon}_i \sim N(0,\sigma_i^2)$ and is assumed to be independent of $\tilde{P}_1$, we have that the marginal distribution for $\tilde{y}_i$ is $N(m,\sigma^2 + \sigma_i^2)$. The covariance of $\tilde{P}_1$ and $\tilde{y}_i$ equals $E[(P_1 - m)(\tilde{y}_i - m)] = E[(P_1 - m)(P_1 + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i - m)] = E[(P_1 - m)^2 + (P_1 - m)\varepsilon_i] = E[A(P_1 - m)^2] = \sigma^2$. Thus, the correlation between $\tilde{P}_1$ and $\tilde{y}_i$ equals $\rho_i = \sigma^2 / |\sigma \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \sigma_i^2}| = \sigma / \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \sigma_i^2}$. Now Bayes Rule relates conditional and marginal probabilities. For a continuous distribution such as the normal, if we have two random variables, say $X$ and $Z$ whose joint and marginal probability density functions are $f(x,z)$, $f(x)$, and $f(z)$ respectively, then Bayes Rule says that the conditional probability densities satisfy

f (x \mid z) = \frac {f (z \mid x) f (x)}{f (z)} = \frac {f (x , z)}{f (z)}

Let the joint bivariate normal density for $P_{1}$ and $y_{i}$ be $n(P_{1},y_{i},\rho_{i})$ and denote the marginal normal densities of $P_{1}$ and $y_{i}$ by $n(P_{1})$ and $n(y_{i})$. Give the assumed means variances and covariances, we have

$$

Now $n(P_1, y_i, \rho_i)$ can be re-arranged to take the form

$$
n \left(P _ {1}, y _ {i}, \rho_ {i}\right) = n \left(y _ {i}\right) \frac {1}{\sigma \sqrt {1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}} \sqrt {2 \pi}} \exp \left[ - \frac {\left| P _ {1} - \left| m \left(1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}\right) + y _ {i} \right| \right| ^ {2}}{2 \sigma^ {2} \left| 1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2} \right|} \right]

Thus, Bayes Rule states that the conditional density of $P_{1}$ given $y_{i}$ is

$$

Thus, from this observation we can see that $E[P_1|y_i] = m(1 - \rho_i^2) + y_i$ and $\operatorname{var}[P_1|y_i] = \sigma^2 (1 - \rho_i^2)$.","Bayes' theorem for continuous distributions, Bivariate normal distribution, Conditional expectation and variance, Correlation coefficient derivation",

$$
Since the asset is in zero net supply, $X_{1} + X_{2} = 0$, so that

$$
\frac {m + \rho^ {2} \left(y _ {1} - m\right) - R _ {f} P _ {0}}{a _ {1} \sigma^ {2} \left(1 - \rho^ {2}\right)} + \frac {m + \rho^ {2} \left(y _ {2} - m\right) - R _ {f} P _ {0}}{a _ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(1 - \rho^ {2}\right)} = 0

Substituting the equilibrium price in the above equation proves that $X_{1} + X_{2} = 0$. However, we have even a stronger result.

To find  $\Theta = (\theta_1 \, \theta_2)$ , which is the vector of market prices of risk associated with the independent Brownian motions, note from (3) we can take  $dz_1 = dz_r$ , so that  $\theta_1 = \theta_r$ . To find  $\theta_2$ , note from (3) that  $dz_y = \rho dz_1 + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} dz_2$ .

Thus from (4) we see that

 \kappa = \left( \begin{array}{c c} \alpha - \alpha \\ 0 & \delta \end{array} \right) \tag {5}

and

$$
 \left( \begin{array}{c} - \sigma_ {r} \theta_ {r} \\ \delta \bar {y} - \sigma_ {y} \theta_ {y} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{c} \alpha \left(\bar {x} _ {1} - \bar {x} _ {2}\right) \\ \delta x _ {2} \end{array} \right) \tag {6}

To derive the formula for a zero-coupon bond's price,  $P(t,T,x) = e^{-Y(t,T,x)(T - t)}$ , where  $Y(t,T,x)\tau = A(\tau) + B(\tau)x$  and  $\tau \equiv T - t$ , we need to find  $A(\tau)$  and  $B(\tau)$  from the ordinary differential equations (17.18) and (17.19) subject to the boundary conditions  $A(0) = 0$  and  $B(0)$  is a  $2 \times 1$  vector of zeros. Starting with (17.19) we have

$$

A solution to the ordinary differential equation  $\partial B_{1} / \partial \tau +\alpha B_{1} = 1$  subject to the boundary condition  $B_{1}(0) = 0$  is

$$
 B _ {1} (\tau) = \left(1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}\right) / \alpha \tag {10}
$$

Substituting this into the second line of (9), we have the ordinary differential equation  $\partial B_2 / \partial \tau +\delta B_2 = 1 - e^{-\alpha \tau}$  subject to the boundary condition  $B_{2}(0) = 0$  . Its solution is

 B _ {2} (\tau) = \frac {\alpha}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta \tau}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}}{\alpha}\right) \tag {11}

Integrating equation (12) produces the expression

$$
