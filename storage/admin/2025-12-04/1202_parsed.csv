For limited liability assets, such as oil, we cannot have a bubble path with a price becoming negative, so we need to consider only bubbles with $b_{t} > 0$. In this case, we see from the above equation (*) that for a bubble solution to exist, the bubble component must be expected to increase infinitely. But this cannot be a rational expectation if there is an upper bound on the price of oil, as would be the case if there was a perfect substitute in perfectly elastic supply. Thus, since $p_{t}$ cannot rise above $p_{\mathrm{solar}}$, $b_{t}$ cannot rise above $p_{\mathrm{solar}} - p_{t}^{*}$. Thus, a bubble path where $b_{t}$ must be expected to increase to infinity cannot possibly occur.",,
,,,"For similar reasons, a rational speculative bubble cannot exist for the price of a bond. Since, at maturity, the bond's price must be $p_{T} = d_{T}$ and zero after date $T$, its price cannot rationally be expected to satisfy equation (*) and increase infinitely. Thus, a bubble path is invalid, and the only rational price is $p_{t} = p_{t}^{\star}$.",,

Since $b_{T} = 0$ with certainty, then the bubble process $E_{t}[b_{t+1}] = \delta^{-1} b_{t}$ implies $E_{T-1}[b_{T}] = E_{T-1}[0] = \delta^{-1} b_{T-1}$, or $b_{T-1} = 0$.

,,,"By purchasing a foreign currency at the initial dollar price $S_0$, one can invest in a foreign-currency denominated interest-bearing instrument, such as a foreign bond or a foreign-currency denominated bank (certificate of) deposit.

where  $\alpha(S)$  is an  $nx1$  vector of expected returns and asset prices and  $\nu(S)$  is an  $nxn$  matrix of volatility terms multiplying the  $nx1$  vector of Wiener processes. Note that the elements of  $\alpha(S)$  and  $\nu(S)$  may be functions of each of the asset prices as well as calendar time,  $t$ .  $\nu(S)$  is assumed to be of full rank, which is equivalent to assuming that the returns on any one asset cannot be perfectly hedged by the returns on a portfolio of the other assets. In this sense, none of the assets are assumed to be redundant.

Now consider forming  $n$  portfolios from the  $n$  underlying securities. The goal is to make these  $n$  portfolios be ""primitive"" securities that each depend on a single  $dZ_{i}$  process and have unit variance. This can be done by using share amounts of each of the original  $n$  securities equal to the rows of  $v^{-1}$ . Thus, letting  $P = (P_{1}\dots P_{n})$  be the  $nx1$  vector of prices for the  $n$  primitive portfolios, they will equal
$$
P = v ^ {- 1} S \tag {9}
$$
and the process followed by these primitive security portfolios is
$$
\begin{array}{l} d P = v ^ {- 1} d S = v ^ {- 1} \alpha (s) d t + v ^ {- 1} v d Z \\ = \mu_ {p} d t + I d Z \tag {10} \\ \end{array}
$$
where  $\mu_{p} = (\mu_{p1}\dots \mu_{pn})^{\prime} = v^{-1}\alpha (S)$  and  $I$  is the nxn identity matrix. Using (9) and (10), we can re-write (8) as
$$
\mu_ {c} c - r c = c _ {s} ^ {\prime} v \left(\mu_ {p} - r P\right) \tag {11}
$$
Now from the definition that  $\Theta = (\theta_{1}\dots \theta_{n})^{\prime}$  is the  $n\times 1$  vector of market prices of risks associated with each of the Brownian motions,  $\Theta = \mu_p - rP$ . Using this and equation (4), equation (11) can be re-written as
$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu_ {c} c - r c = c _ {s} ^ {\prime} v \left(\mu_ {p} - r P\right) \\ = \Sigma_ {c} c \Theta \tag {12} \\ \end{array}

To deduce the form of the pricing kernel, if
$$
d M = \mu_ {m} d t + \sigma_ {m} ^ {\prime} d Z \tag {14}
$$
where  $\sigma_{m} = (\sigma_{m1}\dots \sigma_{mn})^{\prime}$  is an  $nx1$  vector, then define  $c^{m} = cM$  and apply Ito's lemma:
$$
\begin{array}{l} d c ^ {m} = c d M + M d c + (d c) (d M) \\ = \left[ c \mu_ {m} + M \mu_ {c} c + \Sigma_ {c} c \sigma_ {m} \right] d t + \left[ c \sigma_ {m} ^ {\prime} + M \Sigma_ {c} c \right] d Z \tag {15} \\ \end{array}
$$
If  $c^{m} = cM$  satisfies  $c_{t}M_{t} = E_{t}[c_{T}M_{T}]$ , that is,  $c^{m}$  is a martingale, then its drift in (15) must be zero, implying
$$
\mu_ {c} = - \frac {\mu_ {m}}{M} - \frac {\sum_ {c} \sigma_ {m}}{M} \tag {16}
$$
For the case in which  $c$  is the instantaneously riskless asset, all of the elements of  $\Sigma_c$  are zero and therefore  $\mu_c = r(t)$ . This requires
$$
r (t) = - \frac {\mu_ {m}}{M} \tag {17}
$$
Next, consider the case where asset  $C$  is one of the primitive securities, say the  $i^{\text{th}}$  one. In this case  $\mu_{c} = \mu_{pi} / P_{i}$  and  $\sum_{c}\sigma_{m} = (1 / P_{i})\sigma_{mi}$ . Hence, using equation (17), equation (16) becomes
$$
\frac {\mu_ {p i}}{P _ {i}} = r - \frac {\sigma_ {m i}}{P _ {i} M} \tag {18}
$$
Rearranging (18), we have

,,,"For the single-period CAPM results to obtain, one needs to assume constant investment opportunities so that risky asset rates of return have constant means, variances, and covariances and the risk-free interest rate is constant. This implies that risky asset prices follow geometric Brownian motion and are lognormally distributed over discrete intervals. Alternatively, if all individuals have log utility, the CAPM results hold instantaneously, though asset prices' means and covariance matrix can be changing over time.",,
,,,"The instantaneous-maturity interest rate can be interpreted as a state variable that changes investment opportunities. Suppose that risk-aversion is greater than log utility, so that the wealth effect exceeds the substitution effect. In this case a rise in  $r(t)$  leads to an increase in optimal consumption  $(\partial C / \partial r > 0)$  and a fall in  $r(t)$  leads to a decline in optimal consumption  $(\partial C / \partial r > 0)$ . To hedge against unfavorable shifts in investment opportunities, there will be an additional hedging demand for assets that have a positive return when  $r(t)$  declines. An example of such an asset is a long-term bond, so that there should be a demand for long term bonds that exceed what would be predicted by the single-period Markowitz results. Conversely, suppose that risk-aversion is less than log utility, so that the substitution effect is greater than the wealth effect. In this case a rise in  $r(t)$  leads to a decline in optimal consumption  $(\partial C / \partial r < 0)$  and a fall in  $r(t)$  leads to a rise in optimal consumption  $(\partial C / \partial r > 0)$ . To hedge against unfavorable shifts in investment opportunities, there will be an additional hedging demand for assets that have a negative return when  $r(t)$  declines. In this case, individuals might want to short a long-term bond to hedge against a rise in  $r(t)$ , that is, there will be a hedging demand for long-term borrowing (e.g., via a mortgage) so that there should be a net demand for long term bonds that is less than what would be predicted by the single-period Markowitz results.

Since $\tilde{y}_i = \tilde{P}_1 + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i$ and $\tilde{\varepsilon}_i \sim N(0,\sigma_i^2)$ and is assumed to be independent of $\tilde{P}_1$, we have that the marginal distribution for $\tilde{y}_i$ is $N(m,\sigma^2 + \sigma_i^2)$. The covariance of $\tilde{P}_1$ and $\tilde{y}_i$ equals $E[(P_1 - m)(\tilde{y}_i - m)] = E[(P_1 - m)(P_1 + \tilde{\varepsilon}_i - m)] = E[(P_1 - m)^2 + (P_1 - m)\varepsilon_i] = E[A(P_1 - m)^2] = \sigma^2$. Thus, the correlation between $\tilde{P}_1$ and $\tilde{y}_i$ equals $\rho_i = \sigma^2 / |\sigma \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \sigma_i^2}| = \sigma / \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \sigma_i^2}$. Now Bayes Rule relates conditional and marginal probabilities. For a continuous distribution such as the normal, if we have two random variables, say $X$ and $Z$ whose joint and marginal probability density functions are $f(x,z)$, $f(x)$, and $f(z)$ respectively, then Bayes Rule says that the conditional probability densities satisfy

$$
f (x \mid z) = \frac {f (z \mid x) f (x)}{f (z)} = \frac {f (x , z)}{f (z)}

Let the joint bivariate normal density for $P_{1}$ and $y_{i}$ be $n(P_{1},y_{i},\rho_{i})$ and denote the marginal normal densities of $P_{1}$ and $y_{i}$ by $n(P_{1})$ and $n(y_{i})$. Give the assumed means variances and covariances, we have

$$
n \left(P _ {1}, y _ {i}, \rho_ {i}\right) = \frac {1}{2 \pi \sigma \sqrt {\sigma^ {2} + \sigma_ {i} ^ {2}} \sqrt {1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}}} \exp \left[ - \frac {\frac {\left(P _ {1} - m\right) ^ {2}}{\sigma^ {2}} - \frac {2 \rho_ {1} \left(P _ {1} - m\right) \left(y _ {i} - m\right)}{\sigma \sqrt {\sigma^ {2} + \sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}} + \frac {\left(y _ {i} - m\right) ^ {2}}{\sigma^ {2} + \sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}}{2 \left(1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}\right)} \right]

$$

Now $n(P_1, y_i, \rho_i)$ can be re-arranged to take the form

$$
n \left(P _ {1}, y _ {i}, \rho_ {i}\right) = n \left(y _ {i}\right) \frac {1}{\sigma \sqrt {1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}} \sqrt {2 \pi}} \exp \left[ - \frac {\left| P _ {1} - \left| m \left(1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}\right) + y _ {i} \right| \right| ^ {2}}{2 \sigma^ {2} \left| 1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2} \right|} \right]
$$

Thus, Bayes Rule states that the conditional density of $P_{1}$ given $y_{i}$ is

$$
\begin{array}{l} n \left(P _ {1} \mid y _ {i}\right) = \frac {n \left(P _ {1} , y _ {i} , \rho_ {i}\right)}{n \left(y _ {i}\right)} \\ = \frac {1}{\sigma \sqrt {1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}} \sqrt {2 \pi}} \exp \left[ - \frac {\left(P _ {1} - \left[ m \left(1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}\right) + y _ {i} \right]\right) ^ {2}}{2 \sigma^ {2} \left(1 - \rho_ {i} ^ {2}\right)} \right] \\ \end{array}

Notice that $n(P_1|y_i)$ is of the same form as a univariate normal density function for the variable $P_1$ having a mean of $[m(1 - \rho_i^2) + y_i]$ and a variance of $\sigma^2 (1 - \rho_i^2)$. Thus, from this observation we can see that $E[P_1|y_i] = m(1 - \rho_i^2) + y_i$ and $\operatorname{var}[P_1|y_i] = \sigma^2 (1 - \rho_i^2)$.",,

where if $I_{i}$ just equals $y_{i}$, then $E[\tilde{P}_{1}|I_{i}] = m + \rho^{2}(y_{i} - m)$ and var $[\tilde{P}_1|I_i] = \sigma^2 (1 - \rho^2)$, where $\rho^2\equiv \frac{\sigma^2 + \sigma_\tau^2}{\sigma^2 + \sigma_\tau^2}$. Substituting these conditional moments into the above equation gives

Since the asset is in zero net supply, $X_{1} + X_{2} = 0$, so that

where $\overline{\rho}^2\equiv \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + \sigma_t^2 / 2}$.Trader $i$, s equilibrium demand, $X_{i},$ is given by using $E[\bar{P}_1|I_i] = m(1 - \bar{\rho}^2) + \frac{1}{2}\bar{\rho}^2 (y_1 + y_2)$ and var $[\bar{P}_1|I_i] = \sigma^2 (1 - \bar{\rho}^2),$ that is,

$$
X _ {i} = \frac {m \left(1 - \bar {\rho} ^ {2}\right) + \frac {1}{2} \bar {\rho} ^ {2} \left(y _ {1} + y _ {2}\right) - R _ {f} P _ {0}}{a _ {i} \sigma^ {2} \left(1 - \bar {\rho} ^ {2}\right)}
$$

Substituting the equilibrium price in the above equation proves that $X_{1} + X_{2} = 0$. However, we have even a stronger result. Note that since the numerators of $X_{i}, i = 1,2$ are the same, it must be the case that $X_{1} = X_{2} = 0$, so that in this fully revealing case each individual takes a zero position in the risky asset even though their risk aversions differ.",,
,,,"Following the notation in the text, let the state variable process be

$$
d x = a (x) d t + b d z \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mathrm{x}(t) = (r(t)\gamma (t))^{\prime}$

$$
a (x) = \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \delta \bar {y} \end{array} \right) + \left( \begin{array}{c c} - \alpha & \alpha \\ 0 & - \delta \end{array} \right) x \tag {2}
$$

$$
b = \left( \begin{array}{c c} \sigma_ {r} & 0 \\ \sigma_ {y} \rho & \sigma_ {y} \sqrt {1 - \rho^ {2}} \end{array} \right) \tag {3}
$$

and  $dz = (dz_1 \, dz_2)'$  is a vector of independent Brownian motion processes so that  $dz_1 dz_2 = 0$ . Note that the covariance matrix in (3) results in the same variances and covariances as in the case of the correlated Brownian motions  $dz_r$  and  $d\hat{z}_r$ . To find  $\Theta = (\theta_1 \, \theta_2)$ , which is the vector of market prices of risk associated with the independent Brownian motions, note from (3) we can take  $dz_1 = dz_r$ , so that  $\theta_1 = \theta_r$ . To find  $\theta_2$ , note from (3) that  $dz_y = \rho dz_1 + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} dz_2$ . Since  $d\hat{z}_y = dz_y + \theta_y dt$ , and we want  $d\hat{z}_y = \rho d\hat{z}_1 + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} d\hat{z}_2$ , this implies that  $dz_y + \theta_y dt = \rho (dz_1 + \theta_r dt) + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} (dz_2 + \theta_2 dt)$ . By equating the coefficients of the  $dt$  terms we have  $\theta_y = \rho \theta_r + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} \theta_2$  or

Now equation (17.14) in the text becomes

$$
a (x) - b \Theta = \kappa (\bar {x} - x)
$$

$$
\left| \begin{array}{c} - \sigma_ {r} \theta_ {r} \\ \delta \bar {\gamma} - \sigma_ {y} \theta_ {y} \end{array} \right| + \left( \begin{array}{c c} - \alpha & \alpha \\ 0 & - \delta \end{array} \right) x = \kappa \quad \overline {{x}} - \kappa x \tag {4}
$$

Thus from (4) we see that

$$
\kappa = \left( \begin{array}{c c} \alpha - \alpha \\ 0 & \delta \end{array} \right) \tag {5}
$$

and

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c} - \sigma_ {r} \theta_ {r} \\ \delta \bar {y} - \sigma_ {y} \theta_ {y} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{c} \alpha \left(\bar {x} _ {1} - \bar {x} _ {2}\right) \\ \delta x _ {2} \end{array} \right) \tag {6}
$$

so that

$$
\bar {x} = \left( \begin{array}{c} \bar {\gamma} - \sigma_ {\gamma} \theta_ {\gamma} / \delta - \sigma_ {r} \theta_ {r} / \alpha \\ \bar {\gamma} - \sigma_ {\gamma} \theta_ {\gamma} / \delta \end{array} \right) \tag {7}
$$

Further, equation (17.15) in the text becomes

$$
b = \Sigma \sqrt {s (x)}
$$

$$
\left| \begin{array}{c c} \sigma_ {r} & 0 \\ \sigma_ {y} \rho & \sigma_ {y} \sqrt {1 - \rho^ {2}} \end{array} \right| = \Sigma \sqrt {\mathrm {s} (\mathrm {x})} \tag {8}
$$

which implies that we can take  $\Sigma = b$  and let  $s$  be the identity matrix where  $s_{oi} = 1$  and  $s_{1i} = 0$ . Lastly, from  $r(t,x) = \alpha + \beta'x$ , we have that  $\alpha = 0$  and  $\beta' = (1 - 0)$ .

To derive the formula for a zero-coupon bond's price,  $P(t,T,x) = e^{-Y(t,T,x)(T - t)}$ , where  $Y(t,T,x)\tau = A(\tau) + B(\tau)^x$  and  $\tau \equiv T - t$ , we need to find  $A(\tau)$  and  $B(\tau)$  from the ordinary differential equations (17.18) and (17.19) subject to the boundary conditions  $A(0) = 0$  and  $B(0)$  is a  $2 \times 1$  vector of zeros. Starting with (17.19) we have

$$
\frac {\partial \mathrm {B} (\tau)}{\partial \tau} = \beta - \kappa^ {\prime} \mathrm {B} (\tau) - \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} [ \Sigma^ {\prime} \mathrm {B} (\tau) ] _ {i} ^ {2} \mathrm {s} _ {1 i}
$$

$$
\left( \begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial B _ {1} (\tau)}{\partial \tau} \\ \frac {\partial B _ {2} (\tau)}{\partial \tau} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{l} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right) - \left( \begin{array}{c} \alpha B _ {1} \\ - \alpha B _ {1} + \delta B _ {2} \end{array} \right) \tag {9}
$$

A solution to the ordinary differential equation  $\partial B_{1} / \partial \tau +\alpha B_{1} = 1$  subject to the boundary condition  $B_{1}(0) = 0$  is

$$
B _ {1} (\tau) = \left(1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}\right) / \alpha \tag {10}
$$

Substituting this into the second line of (9), we have the ordinary differential equation  $\partial B_2 / \partial \tau +\delta B_2 = 1 - e^{-\alpha \tau}$  subject to the boundary condition  $B_{2}(0) = 0$  . Its solution is

$$
B _ {2} (\tau) = \frac {\alpha}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta \tau}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}}{\alpha}\right) \tag {11}
$$

Now equation (17.18) is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial A (\tau)}{\partial \tau} = \alpha + (\kappa \bar {x}) ^ {\prime} B (\tau) - \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} [ \Sigma^ {\prime} B (\tau) ] _ {i} ^ {2} s _ {0 i} \\ = - \frac {\sigma_ {r} \theta_ {r}}{\alpha} \left(1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}\right) + \frac {\alpha \left(\delta \bar {y} - \sigma_ {y} \theta_ {y}\right)}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta \tau}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}}{\alpha}\right) \\ - \frac {1}{2} \left[ \frac {\sigma_ {r}}{\alpha} \left(1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}\right) + \frac {\alpha \sigma_ {y} \rho}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta \tau}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}}{\alpha}\right) \right] ^ {2} \\ - \frac {1}{2} \left[ \frac {\alpha \sigma_ {y} \sqrt {1 - \rho^ {2}}}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta \tau}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha \tau}}{\alpha}\right) \right] ^ {2} \tag {12} \\ \end{array}
$$

Integrating equation (12) produces the expression

$$
\begin{array}{l} A (\tau) = \int^ {\tau} \left\{- \frac {\sigma_ {r} \theta_ {r}}{\alpha} \left(1 - e ^ {- \alpha t}\right) + \frac {\alpha \left(\delta \bar {y} - \sigma_ {y} \theta_ {y}\right)}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta t}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha t}}{\alpha}\right) \right. \\ - \frac {1}{2} \left[ \frac {\sigma_ {r}}{\alpha} \left(1 - e ^ {- \alpha t}\right) + \frac {\alpha \sigma_ {y} \rho}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta t}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha t}}{\alpha}\right) \right] ^ {2} \\ \left. - \frac {1}{2} \left[ \frac {\alpha \sigma_ {y} \sqrt {1 - \rho^ {2}}}{\alpha - \delta} \left(\frac {1 - e ^ {- \delta t}}{\delta} - \frac {1 - e ^ {- \alpha t}}{\alpha}\right) \right] ^ {2} \right\} d t + c \tag {13} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $c$  is a constant determined by the boundary condition  $A(0) = 0$ . Computing this integral of exponential terms and solving for  $C$  is straightforward but tedious. The resulting expression for  $A(\tau)$  can be written as",,
